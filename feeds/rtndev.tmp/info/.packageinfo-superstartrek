Description:  Super Star Trek is quite possibly the best of the Star Trek games
 from the 1970s. Of course, it does not make use of graphics, or even assume
 a video display, but it still an interesting game to play, particularly for
 those of us who don't have the reflexes we used to and  prefer a more cerebral
 computer game.
