Description:  NetHogs is a small 'net top' tool. Instead of breaking the traffic down per protocol 
 or per subnet, like most tools do, it groups bandwidth by process. NetHogs does not rely
 on a special kernel module to be loaded. If there's suddenly a lot of network traffic, 
 you can fire up NetHogs and immediately see which PID is causing this. This makes it easy 
 to indentify programs that have gone wild and are suddenly taking up your bandwidth.
