Title: NetHack is a single player dungeon exploration game
Maintainer: Entware team, entware.wl500g.info
Source: nethack-343-src.tgz
Type: ipkg
Description:  Unlike many other Dungeons & Dragons-inspired games, the emphasis in
 NetHack is on discovering the detail of the dungeon and not simply killing
 everything in sight - in fact, killing everything in sight is a good way
 to die quickly.
