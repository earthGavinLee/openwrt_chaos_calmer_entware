Title: Purely passive traffic fingerprinting
Maintainer: Entware team, entware.wl500g.info
Source: p0f-3.08b.tgz
Type: ipkg
Description:  P0f is a tool that utilizes an array of sophisticated, purely passive traffic
 fingerprinting mechanisms to identify the players behind any incidental TCP/IP
 communications (often as little as a single normal SYN) without interfering in
 any way.
