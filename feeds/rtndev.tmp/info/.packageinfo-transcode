Title: A/V transcoding suite
Maintainer: Entware team, entware.wl500g.info
Source: transcode-1.1.5.tar.bz2
Type: ipkg
Description:  Transcode is a suite of tools, all of which are command line utilities
 for transcoding various video, audio, and container formats. Please note
 it's compiled without any external recoding libraries because transcoding is
 too heavy task for a router. Only few tools will be usefull, i.e. tcprobe.
