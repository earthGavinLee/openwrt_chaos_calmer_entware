Title: a user-space USB HID access library
Maintainer: Entware team, entware.wl500g.info
Source: libhid-0.2.16.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description:  libhid provides a generic and flexible way to access and interact with USB HID
 devices, much like libusb does for plain USB devices. It is based on libusb
 0.1, thus it requires no special HID support in the kernel. Furthermore, it
 aims to support all operating system supported by libusb.
