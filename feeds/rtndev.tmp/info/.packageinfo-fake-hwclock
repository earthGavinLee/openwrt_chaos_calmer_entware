Title: loads/saves current kernel clock from/to file
Maintainer: Entware team, entware.wl500g.info
Source: fake-hwclock_0.9.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description:  Trivial script to load/save current contents of the kernel clock
 from/to a file. Helpful as a *bootstrap* clock on machines where
 there isn't a useful RTC driver (e.g. on development boards). Using
 NTP is still recommended on these machines to get to real time sync
 once more of the system is up and running.
